They emphasize the importance of aligning technology with moral equilibrium and advocate for a regulatory approach that ensures both progress and respect for human autonomy. While the Scientist contributes valuable insights on safety, evidence-based guidelines, and innovation, their focus is more centered around practical implementation rather than ethical implications.
