Additionally, stringent regulation might limit experimental approaches necessary for breakthroughs in medical AI applications. Therefore, an adaptive regulatory framework with clear guidelines and continuous assessment of risks versus benefits could be more appropriate to safeguard both public health and technological progress.",
